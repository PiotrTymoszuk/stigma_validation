# Supplementary Methods

## Software

Proteome and metabolome data were analyzed with R version 4.2.0. 
General data transformation tasks were accomplished with the _tidyverse_ package bundle [@Wickham2019], _rlang_ [@Henry2022] and the development package _trafo_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/trafo). 
Statistical data testing was done with the packages _rstatix_ [@Kassambara2021], _ggpubr_ [@Kassambara2020] along with the development package _ExDA_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/ExDA). 
In linear modeling, base R functions, the development packages _lmqc_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/lmqc) and _caretExtra_ (https://github.com/PiotrTymoszuk/caretExtra), and the package _caret_ [@Kuhn2008] were utilized.

Results were visualized with tools provided by the packages _ggplot2_ [@Wickham2016], _cowplot_ [@Wilke2019] and _ExDA_. 
Manuscript and supplementary tables were created with _flextable_ [@Gohel2022]. 
Supplementary Material file was written in the _rmarkdown_ environment [@Allaire2022] and rendered with the _knitr_ [@Xie2022] and _bookdown_ [@Xie2016] packages.

## INCOV cohort data import and transformation

Proteome and metabolome data in form of normalized, age- and sex-adjusted, log~2~-transformed serum levels as well as clinical information (sex, SARS-CoV-2 infection status, COVID-19 severity, timepoint, post-COVID-19 syndrome status and particular symptoms) for the INCOV cohort were extracted from supplementary tables accompanying the report by Su and colleagues [@Su2022]. 

Characteristic of the INCOV cohorts is presented in __Table 2__. 
Numbers of available INCOV cohort samples and the sampling timepoints are shown in __Supplementary Table S\@ref(tab:tab-samples)__.

## Variable distribution and transformation

Distribution normality and variance homogeneity of normalized cytokine and metabolite serum levels was assessed by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively. 
The distribution testing revealed substantial deviations from normality for multiple study parameters. 
For this reason statistical hypothesis testing in the INCOV dataset was done with non-parametric tests. 
For SIMMUN cohort metabolite and inflammation marker levels (KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, PHE, TYR and PHE/TYR ratio, NEO, CRP, IL6, anti-RBD IgG) used in analysis of correlation with age and mental disorder scoring, comparison between participants stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status or gender as well as for linear modeling, logarithm and square root transformations was used, which improved both normality and variance homogeneity.

## Statistical hypothesis testing

Comparison of normalized serum cytokine and metabolite levels between uninfected controls and COVID-19 individuals from the INCOV cohort at consecutive timepoints after symptom onset was done with Kruskal-Wallis test. 
Differences between SARS-CoV-2-negative controls and consecutive timepoints of COVID-19 were investigated with Mann-Whitney post-hoc U test corrected for multiple testing with Benjamini-Hochberg method [@Benjamini1995]. 

Correlation of serum cytokine and metabolite levels in uninfected controls and COVID-19 individuals at consecutive timepoints in the INCOV and SIMMUN datasets was analyzed by Spearman test. 
Correlation of serum cytokine and metabolite levels with scores of anxiety, depression and stress was assessed by Spearman test. 
Correlation of SIMMUN dataset metabolite levels with age was assessed by Pearson test.

Comparison of SIMMUN dataset metabolite and inflammatory marker levels between participants stratified by SARS-CoV-2 infection status or gender was done with two-tailed T test. 

## Multi-parameter linear regression with backwards elimination

Effects of the representative inflammation marker (NEO), SARS-CoV-2 infection status, titre of immunoglobulin gamma against the receptor binding domain of the S1 SARS-CoV-2 protein (anti-RBD IgG), anxiety (HADS), depression (HADS) and stress scoring (PSS-4), age and gender on systemic levels of aminoacid neurotransmitter precursor and their decay products (TRP, KYN, KYN/TRP ratio, PHE, TYR and PHE/TYR ratio) was assessed by multi-parameter linear regression with backwards elimination. 
Modeling responses and numeric explanatory variables were transformed with log or squared root functions to improve normality and normalized. 

Full models including the complete set of explanatory variables listed above were constructed (function `make_lm()`, package _lmqc_) and optimized by Bayesian information criterion (AIC) driven backwards elimination of non-significant terms (method `step()`, package _lmqc_). 
Normality and homogeneity of distribution of the model residuals was checked by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively (method `summary(type = 'assumptions')`, package _lmqc_) and visually inspected in standard diagnostic plots of model residuals (residuals vs fitted, quantile-quantile plots, method `plot()` called for the model objects). 
Fit stats ($R^2$ and root mean squared error [RMSE]) were retrieved from the model objects by calling `summary(type = 'fit')` (package _lmqc_). 
Validity of the optimized models was determined by likelihood-ratio test (LRT) versus the respective null models (method `anova()`). 
Reproducibility and proper parameterization of the optimized multi-parameter models was investigated by repeated cross-validation (50 repeats, 10 folds, function `train(method = 'lm')`, package _caret_) and by comparison of the RMSE and $R^2$ statistics obtained with in the training dataset and in cross-validation (method `summary()`, package _caretExtra_). 
As presented in __Supplementary Figure S\@ref(fig:fig-fit-stats)A__, similar values of error fit in the training and cross-validation data suggest good reproducibility of the optimized models and lack of over-parameterization.
