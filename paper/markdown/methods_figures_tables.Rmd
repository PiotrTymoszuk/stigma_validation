# Methods

## Bioinformatic and statistical analysis

R version 4.2.0 was employed for the data analysis.

Normalized, age- and sex-adjusted, log~2~-transformed serum protein and metabolite levels and clinical data for the INCOV cohort were extracted from the report by Su at al. [@Su2022]. 

Normality and homogeneity of variances was investigated by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively. 
Non-parametric tests or normality/homogeneity-improving variable transformations (logarithm and square root) were used in cases of non-normal distribution. 
Comparison of serum metabolite and cytokine levels between uninfected controls and COVID-19 individuals at consecutive timepoints after infection was done by Kruskal-Wallis test with Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected Mann-Whitney post-hoc test [@Benjamini1995]. 
Correlations of metabolite and cytokine serum levels and of mental disorder scoring with metabolite and cytokine levels was investigated by Spearman test. 
Correlation of SIMMUN dataset metabolite levels with age was accomplished by Pearson test. 
Significance of differences in SIMMUN cohort metabolite and inflammatory marker serum concentrations between participants stratified by gender or SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by two-tailed T test. 

In multi-parameter linear modeling of aminoacid neurotransmitter precursors and their decay products, neopterin (representative inflammation marker), SARS-CoV-2 infection status, scores of anxiety (HADS), depression (HADS) and stress (PSS-4), age and gender served as candidate explanatory variables. 
Modeling responses and numeric explanatory variables were normalized. 
The models models with the complete explanatory variable set were optimized by Bayesian information criterion (BIC) driven backwards elimination of non-significant terms. 
The normality and homogeneity model residual assumptions were by Shapiro-Wilk and Levene test, respectively, and additionally visually inspected in standard diagnostic plots (residuals versus fitted, quantile-quantile plots). 
Reproducibility of the optimized multi-parameter models was investigated by repeated cross-validation (50 repeats, 10 folds) and by comparison of the RMSE and $R^2$ statistics obtained with the training dataset and in cross-validation.

_Effects on metabolism of tryptophan (TRP), the serotonin precursor. SARS-CoV-2-dependent and -independent inflammation reduces systemic TRP levels, stimulates IDO1-mediated conversion of TRP to kynurenin (KYN) and quinolinic acid (QUIN). Independently of inflammation, during recovery from SARS-CoV-2 infection, TRP/KYN/QUIN conversion is stimulated as well. As a result, less substrate for production of the anti-depressive and anxiolytic neurotransmitter serotonin is available, which may predispose to depression or anxiety. Depression and anxiety symptoms on their own are paralleled by decrease in circulating TRP._
